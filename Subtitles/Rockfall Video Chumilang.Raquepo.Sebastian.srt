1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,540
Good day everyone, in this video we'll be

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,860
demonstrating our game project Rockfall a 3D space shooter.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,040
Here we will be discussing about the architecture

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,219
and main components, coding highlights, assets and folder

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:19,100
structure, build and run instructions and known issues

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,500
and possible improvements.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,800
But before that let us demonstrate the game

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,200
first.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,560
So we'll be running the game and we

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:01:01,800
press this button, so

11
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,510
that's basically the game.

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,850
To start let's look at the high-level

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,430
architecture of this project.

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,030
The core logic is handled by the Game

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,830
Manager, a singleton that controls the overall game

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,270
state, switching between the main menu and the

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,170
game over screens as well as managing object

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,610
spawning.

19
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,970
Handling player control is in the Input Manager.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,390
The script translates the inputs from the on

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,170
-screen virtual joystick and fire button so the

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,390
ship can use them.

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,270
It's in here.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,670
The player ship.

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,110
The player ship itself is an structured invisible

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,190
container object.

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,490
It holds the logic scripts like steering and

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,950
thrust while the child object handles the actual

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,730
3d model.

30
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,690
This keeps the logic separate from the visuals.

31
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,730
So the ship is in here.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,160
So if we put this in here we

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,360
can see our ship.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,020
So let's remove this.

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,980
And next our main objective is to defend

36
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,820
the space station.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,200
So here is our space station.

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,760
A static target that uses a damage taking

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,900
script to track itself.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,520
The enemies are asteroid prefabs which are rigid

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
bodies designed to deal damage on impact.

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,160
Generated by an asteroid spawner that aims them

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,400
toward the station.

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,360
And finally to manage visibility we have the

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
indicator manager.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,900
This system calculates the position of off-screen

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,600
objects like the station or enemies and places

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,060
2d markers on the ui so the player

49
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,980
knows which direction it will look.

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,200
Now let's dive into the code implementation with

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,060
ship movement.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,520
In shipcrust.cs, so I'll put it in

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,000
here.

54
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,680
So let's open this first.

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,620
So in shipcrust.cs, we have we achieve

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:06,040
constant forward motion using transform translate multiplying vector

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,360
forward by speed and delta time.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,260
For turning, shipsteering.cs takes the delta data

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,560
from the input manager.

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
So in the game we have our ship

61
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,460
steering in here.

62
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,810
We use quaternion.slurp here to create the

63
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,190
rotation and specifically to dampen the z-axis

64
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,010
ensuring the ship levels out and doesn't roll

65
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,910
uncontrollably.

66
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,890
Next is the weapon system.

67
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,940
So within here let's open this first.

68
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,680
So the ship weapon script handles the shooting

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,460
via fire method.

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,980
Where is the fire method?

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,220
We have it in here.

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,180
That alternates between predefined fire points on the

73
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,340
wings.

74
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,520
This is triggered by coroutine in the input

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
manager called fire weapons which continuously calls the

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
fire method as long as the button is

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
held down.

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,960
For the damage logic, we use two scripts.

79
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,860
So damage and collide detects the hit using

80
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,720
standard unity physics triggers.

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,080
So we have it in here.

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,280
It then calls the take damage and the

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,600
victim's damage taking component which deducts health and

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,840
destroys the object instantiating an explosion prefab if

85
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,360
health is hit zero.

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,400
One of the more interesting feature is the

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,820
off-screen indicators.

88
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,120
In the indicator.cs wherein we have it

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,980
in here.

90
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,450
In the indicator.cs script we use camera

91
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,510
world to viewport point to point the 3d

92
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,230
position of a target into 2d screen space.

93
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,930
We then check if the target is behind

94
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,730
the camera and use matf.clamp to pin

95
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,250
the arrow to the edge of the screen.

96
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,990
And finally for the environment, the asteroid spawner

97
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,570
uses random.unit on unit sphere to pick

98
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,010
a spawn point and look what to aim

99
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,530
the asteroid.

100
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,870
Meanwhile the game manager runs a check in

101
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,650
the update loop.

102
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,130
If the player exceeds the predefined boundary radius,

103
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,030
it triggers a warning or a game over.

104
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,350
So we have it in here.

105
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,010
The game over UI and the boundary.

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Moving on to the project structure.

107
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,160
We have organized the assets for clarity.

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,360
So we have the assets in here.

109
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,900
The models folder which is in here contains

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,480
all our 3d assets like the ship and

111
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,260
station files which are set to generate colliders

112
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,840
and import.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,220
The objects folder is where we keep our

114
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,920
prefabs.

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,640
So we have it in here.

116
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,820
The fully configured ship, shots and explosion ready

117
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,900
for instantiation.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,000
And next our scripts folder is organized by

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
function separating core systems like the game manager

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,380
from component logic like ship steering.

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,780
So early on we already showed it wherein

122
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,640
we have it in here.

123
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,700
Finally the UI folder wherein we have it

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,640
in here wherein we store our sprites for

125
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,840
the joystick and fonts while the skybox holds

126
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,179
the texture assets used to create the deep

127
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,440
space background.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
And next would be to test the game

129
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,880
properly especially the mobile inputs with the unity

130
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,680
remote app.

131
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,260
This allows us to connect a mobile device

132
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,920
and use actual touch screen to drive the

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
virtual joystick inside the editor.

134
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,780
When ready to export we go to the

135
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,580
build settings or the build profiles.

136
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,640
Select the target platform like android and click

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,280
switch platform wherein it will be in here

138
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
if for example you're in here.

139
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
So we click that and press the build.

140
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,120
So now let's go to the known issues

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
and possible improvements for this project.

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,300
So to wrap up there are a few

143
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,180
missing features in the current build.

144
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,400
Gameplay wise the ship doesn't have a damage

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,120
component yet which means the player is invincible

146
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,080
and can't actually be destroyed.

147
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,280
To fix this logic, logic could be added

148
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,000
to handle ship destruction and show a health

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,300
bar.

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,460
So I think we've already fixed this issue

151
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,480
wherein after a while if the station gets

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,520
too many or achieves or it's been hit

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,760
many times enough to drain itself it will

154
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,280
be destroyed and the game over menu will

155
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,200
be shown.

156
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,200
But since it takes too long we won't

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,880
show it in here.

158
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
And next also the asteroid spawning stays the

159
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,260
same the whole time.

160
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,140
It doesn't get harder the longer you play.

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,600
A way to improve this would be to

162
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,860
simply increase the spawn rate or speed as

163
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,120
the game goes on.

164
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,600
Visually the game looks a bit plain right

165
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:53,860
now.

166
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,020
Potential improvements include swapping the simple models for

167
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,440
more detailed ones, adding engine sounds that may

168
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,640
actually change based on your tone speed and

169
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,020
adding effects like smoke and fire to make

170
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,940
the crashes look better.

171
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,220
And that's it for our video.
