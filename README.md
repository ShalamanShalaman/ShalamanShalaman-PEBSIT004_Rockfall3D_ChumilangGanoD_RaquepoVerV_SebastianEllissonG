# ROCKFALL

Rockfall is a 3D space survival game built in Unity. Players pilot a ship to protect a spacestation by evading and shooting down incoming asteroids. The goal is to survive for as long as possible, with a scoring system that rewards both longevity and defensive prowess.

## Known Issues / Limitations
- **Player Invincibility:** The ship cannot be destroyed. It needs a damage system and a health bar.
- **Static Difficulty:** The asteroid spawning doesn't change, making the game no harder over time. The fix is to gradually increase the spawn rate or asteroid speed.
- **Basic Visuals & Sound:** The game is visually plain and lacks immersive sound. Improvements include better 3D models, speed-based engine sounds, and explosion effects for crashes.
